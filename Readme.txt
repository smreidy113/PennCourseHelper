PennCourseHelper is essentially an course-selection helper app. Students can either plan out a semester-by-semester schedule for when to take various in-major courses, based on their preferences and major requirements, or look up what courses would be best suited for them to take in a given department(s) and given their various preferences for classes. The latter is especially helpful in choosing sector requirements. PennCourseHelper uses the PennCourseReview api to find out about various course attributes.
